# Fibronectins

This is a coarse-grained model of a fibronectin monomer. The monomer undergoes unfolding thus exposing hydrophobic binding sites that can interact with other protein monomers and thus drive the self-assembly process. The resulting structure is a fibrillar matrix, its morphology depending on various properties that will be investigated in this project.
